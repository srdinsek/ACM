# Visje-racunske-metode

This are projects for the class Višje računske metode (Advanced computational methods).
Unfortunately they are in Slovene. A fast summary:
1. Time evolution of Schrödinger equation.
2. Eigenvalue problem for a perturbed truncated Hamiltonian. Lanczos algorithm.
3. Trotter-Suzuki and Split step methods. Comparison. Poincaré maps and ergodicity.
4. Quantum many-body problems - qubit chains. On a Heisenberg model. Calculation of ground state energy and correlation functions.
5. Molecular dynamics, heat baths and non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Maxwell's baths and Nosé-Hoover model.
6. Classical Monte-Carlo for 1D Heisenberg model.
7. Quantum Monte-Carlo for Harmonic and anharmonic quantum oscillator.
8. Matrix product states. Entanglement entropy for 1D Heisenberg model.
9. DMRG. Ground state energy and Ground state correlation functions.
10. Hartree-Fock.
