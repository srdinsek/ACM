# Visje-racunske-metode

This are projects for the class Višje računske metode (Advanced computational methods)
Unfortunaly they are in slovene. A fast summary:
1. Time evolution of Schrödinger equation.
2. Eigenvalue problem for a perturbed truncated hamiltonian. Lanczos algorithm.
3. Trotter-Suzuki and Split step methods. Comparison. Poincaré maps and egodicity.
4. Quantum manybody problems - qbit chains. On a Heisenberg model. Calculation of ground state energy and correlation functions.
5. Molecular dynamics, heat baths and nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Maxwell's baths and Nosé-Hoover model.
6. Classical Monte-Carlo for 1D Heisenberg model.
7. Quantum Monte-Carlo for Harmonic and anharmonic quantum oscilator.
8. Matrix product states. Entanglement entropy for 1D Heisenberg model.
9. DMRG. Groundstate energy and Ground state correation functions.
10. Hartree-Fock.
